Assignment: Predictive Modeling for Digital Marketing Campaign Performance
Background: In the realm of digital marketing, the success of campaigns is often
determined by key performance metrics such as engagement rate or cost per mille
(CPM). While performance metrics provide quantitative measures of campaign
effectiveness, creative attributes such as the headline, call-to-action (CTA), hero image,
offer, etc., play a significant role in influencing these metrics. Therefore, understanding
the correlation between creative attributes and campaign performance can provide
valuable insights for designing more effective campaigns in the future.
Problem Statement: You are provided with a dataset containing the historical data of
various digital marketing campaigns. This dataset comprises both the performance
metrics (like impressions, engagements, spends, etc.) and creative attributes (such as
Headline, CTA, Hero image, Offer, etc.) of each campaign.
